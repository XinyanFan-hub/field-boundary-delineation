# Automatic Delineation of Agricultural Fields from Sentinel-2 Images

This repository is dedicated to the results of a group assignment of one of the
minors at the University of Twente.
The aim of the assignment was to train a fully convolutional neural network to
precisely predict the boundaries of agricultural fields.


## FCNs

Apart from the report, the repository also contains the differently trained
networks.
The networks were trained with 600 epochs each.
The digit, behind the network's name defines the number of layers that were used
to train the network.


## Data set

The data set is published under creative-common terms CC-BY-4.0.

The link to the data set will be published soon.
